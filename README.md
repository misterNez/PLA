# PLA
Implementation of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm for binary classification.

DESCRIPTION

-Eighty (x,y) data points are generated and put into classes divided by the line: x = y.

-A random hypothesis line h is generated. The algorithm uses a subset of points (training set) and binary classification to recursively
    alter h, until all training points are properly classified (h = g =~ x - y = 0).

-Compare the final hypothesis line with a difference subset of points (test set).

-Misclassification error of the training set and test set are displayed.
